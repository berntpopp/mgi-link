"""Tool-name compliance with the GeneFoundry Tool-Naming Standard v1.

Every registered tool must be unprefixed, snake_case, <= 50 chars, and start with
a canonical verb so it composes cleanly behind the ``genefoundry-router`` gateway,
which mounts this server under the ``mgi`` namespace (tools surface as
``mgi_<tool>``). Guards against future drift. See issue berntpopp/mgi-link#1.
